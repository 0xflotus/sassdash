It's lodash for Sass. Sassdash.

**NOTE: This is still a work in progress!**

## Getting Started
This library contains most of the (Sass-implementable) functions from [lodash](http://lodash.com).

1. [`git clone https://github.com/davidkpiano/sassdash.git sassdash`](https://github.com/davidkpiano/sassdash.git) inside your project (preferably in a `vendors/` directory)
2. `@import 'path/to/sassdash'` in your project
3. Use your new powers wisely.
